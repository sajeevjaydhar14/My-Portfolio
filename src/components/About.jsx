          <p>
            Hi, I'm Sajeev Jaydhar, a passionate Frontend Developer with a
            strong foundation in HTML, CSS, React, Tailwind CSS, and Git. I
            graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in 2023,
            and since then, I've been dedicated to crafting clean, responsive,
            and user-friendly web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into reality
            through code and constantly strive to stay updated with the latest
            trends in frontend development.
